MODULE 2
Relative clauses
Relative clauses begin with a relative pronoun or a relative adverb.
We use:
who(m)/that to refer to people.
The girl who/that lives next door to Jan is my cousin.
which/that to refer to things.
The shop which/that has just opened in Wendover Street is lovely.
whose with people, animals and objects to show possession.
She’s the girl whose father is a pilot.
That’s the car whose interior was destroyed by fire.
Who, which and that can be omitted when they are the object of the relative clause.
You met a woman. She’s my auntie Mary.
The woman (who) you met is my auntie Mary.
Who, which or that are not omitted when they are the subject of the relative clause.
A girl lives next door. She’s a famous actress.
The girl who lives next door is a famous actress.
