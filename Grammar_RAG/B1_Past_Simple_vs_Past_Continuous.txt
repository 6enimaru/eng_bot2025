Past Simple vs Past Continuous
We use the past simple for an action which happened at a stated time in the past.

BUT
We use the past continuous for an action which was in progress at a stated time in the past. We don’t know when the action started or finished.
At 3 o’clock in the afternoon, he was taking a nap in his room.
We use the past simple for actions which happened one after the other in the past.
First she packed her bags and then she ordered a taxi.
BUT
We use the past continuous for two or more actions which were happening at the same time in the past (simultaneous actions).
She was watering the plants while he was painting the garage.
We use the past continuous to show that someone was interrupted in the middle of an action. We use the past simple to talk about an action that interrupted it.
