Unit 12
12.1 Present Perfect
The Present Perfect is formed with have/has + past participle.

The Present Perfect refers to an action or experience that happened at some time before now.
She's travelled to most parts of the world.
Have you ever been in a car accident?

Positive and negative:
I/We/You/They have (not) been to the Czech Republic.
He/She/It has (not) been to the Czech Republic.

I've been = I have been
We've been = We have been
They've been = They have been

Question:
Where have I/you/we/they been?
Where has she/he/it been?

Yes/No questions with short answers:
Have you been to Russia? Yes, I have./No, I haven't.

been and gone:
She's gone to Portugal. (= she's there now)
She's been to Portugal. (= now she has returned)

12.2 Past Simple and Present Perfect
If we want to say when an action happened, we use the Past Simple not the Present Perfect.
She went to Russia two years ago.
I was in a crash when I was 10.

Notice the time expressions used with the Past Simple.
last night / yesterday / in 1990 / at three o'clock / on Monday

yet, just and already:
