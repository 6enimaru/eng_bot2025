Relative Adverbs
We use:
when/that to refer to a time.
That was the year (when/that) we got married.
where to refer to a place.
The restaurant where we had dinner yesterday is very expensive.
why to give a reason.
The reason (why) she was late is still unclear.
Defining – Non-defining relative clauses
A defining relative clause gives necessary information which is essential to the meaning of the main clause. We do not put it in commas. It is introduced with who, whom, whose, which or that.
The bank which was burgled last week has reopened. (Which bank? The one which was burgled last week.)
A non-defining relative clause gives extra information which is not essential to the meaning of the main clause. We put it in commas. It is introduced with who, whom, whose or which (but not that).
